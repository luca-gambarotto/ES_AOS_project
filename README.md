This project is aimed at coding and building a complete sample application using the OpenCL implementation offered by Mango. Specifically the application developed is a porting of the OpenCL implementation of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm proposed in the Rodinia Benchmark Suite.

The development of the project, aside from the pure code drawing up, allowed me to dig into the technologies for parallel coding, both hardware and software side, dealing with topics that are not usually covered in mandatory courses at Politecnico di Milano.
